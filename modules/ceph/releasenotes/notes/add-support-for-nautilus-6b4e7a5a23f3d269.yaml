features:
  - |
    Support for Ceph Nautilus release (LTS) has been added to puppet-ceph.
issues:
  - |
    puppet-ceph can still work with previous release Luminous (LTS) and Mimic
    but only working with LVM backend. Filestore based OSDs are not longer
    supported by puppet-ceph, so the recommendation is to keep using latest
    2.X.Y to manage Luminous and Mimic deployments.
